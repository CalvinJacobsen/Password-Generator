# Homework 3 Javascipt Password generator 

This is the third homework assignment for the Fullstack coding bootcamp. In this homework assignment we had to develop javascript code that would generate a random password based on user critera.

## Desription and Overview

This is my random password generator that I built. The JS code is mine except for the writePassword() function. The index.html and CSS was provided for this assignment as well. My task was to create Javascript that would allow the user to generate a random password based on a set of criteria that they specify. The bullet points below are my prompts for the code.

* Number of characters long the password is (8 - 128)

* What kind of characters to include in the password ex. Uppercase, lowercase, numerals, special characters...

These are the two things that I  prompted for via js alert functions and after that a function is ran to generate the password.

## Requirements for Assignment

Below are the user requirements for the application

```
